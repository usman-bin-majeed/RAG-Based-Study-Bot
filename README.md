```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install streamlit google-generativeai python-dotenv PyPDF2 python-docx
```

4. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your Google API key:
```
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Usage üí°

1. Start the application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
The application will open in your default web browser at `http://localhost:8501`

2. Upload your documents:

   - Use clear, well-formatted documents for best results
   - Keep individual file sizes reasonable (preferably under 10MB)

2. Asking Questions:
   - Be specific in your questions
   - Start with broader questions before diving into details
   - Use follow-up questions to clarify information

3. Performance Optimization:
   - Process related documents together
